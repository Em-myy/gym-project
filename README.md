A full-stack fitness website built with React (frontend) and Node.js + Express (backend).
It allows users to explore gym services, register for memberships, view workout plans, and manage their profiles.

It used React and tailwind for the frontend and styling and then used node and express for the backend and mongoDb for the database.

It also stores the data the user supplied when signing up to the website in the database.

The site was deployed on render and this is the link https://gym-project-jel9.onrender.com
